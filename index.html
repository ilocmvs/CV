      <p><em>Phd candidate, <a href="https://www.cee.ucla.edu">Civil Engineering</a></em></p>
      <p>As a computational material science PhD, my research focus on using molecular dynamic simulations (VASP, Lammps, CP2K, Phonopy series, etc) to calculate, evaluate and predict the properties of glass-related materials (glasses, zeolites, clay phases, etc). Some of my previous findings include evaluating the nature of glasses made from different fabrication methods, and predicting zeolite formation during nuclear waste immobilization glass dissolution.</p>
      <p>Before doing simulations, I was a semiconductor device engineer who was experienced in the fabrication of transistors, diodes, etc. that are based on 2-D materials, solution-processed oxides, single organic molecule layers and so on. Two-year cleanroom lab training familiarized me with all kinds of deposition, solution processing, etching, lithography, measurement and characterization techniques.</p>
      <p>Beyond my researches, I am a passionate programmer and learner in computer science who enjoys using automation scripts and machine learning methods to increase working efficiency and solve real-life problems. My cooperation with Amap.com in China has successfully built a model (trained by designs on Figma) based on VGG neural networks that is able to transform front-end web design images into real web pages. I also team up with my lab mates to construct a visual assistant Android software using the well-trained Google cloud vision API that can recognize texts from images with high accuracy, which may help people with bad visions to read information in images.</p></td>
